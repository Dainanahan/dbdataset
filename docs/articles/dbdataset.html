<p><strong>dbdataset</strong> is a data package containing 75 different data frames that constitute the dataset parsed from <a href="https://www.drugbank.ca">DrugBank</a>. The dataset was extracted from the DrugBank XML database via <a href="https://dainanahan.github.io/dbparser/">dbparser</a> R package.</p>
<p>The dataset can be used for conveniently exploring and analyzing the contents of the DrugBank database. The dataset is also intended to assist in drug discovery endeavors that plan to make use of the <strong>DrugBank</strong> database.</p>
<p>Moreover; it also can be used to in Machine Learning in many sub-fields such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</li>
<li>Web Scrapping</li>
<li>Visualization</li>
</ul>
<div id="installation" class="section level3">

<a href="#installation" class="anchor"></a>Installation</h3>
<p>As the package size exceeds the limit set by CRAN, it will be hosted on Github only for now. Hence, it could be installed via the following command.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="kw pkg">devtools</span><span class="kw ns">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://devtools.r-lib.org//reference/remote-reexports.html">install_github</a></span>(<span class="st">"Dainanahan/dbdataset"</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>The datasets will then be available after running the following command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><html><body><pre class="r"><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/library.html">library</a></span>(<span class="no">dbdataset</span>)</pre></body></html></div>
<p>Then the pakages will be available to be used as regular <em>R</em> object</p>

Cetuximab is marketed under the brand ErbituxÂ® by Eli Lilly and Company. In the United States, a regimen of cetuximab costs approximately $30,790 for an eight-week course.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 3 Dornase alfa is a biosynthetic form of human deoxyribunuclease I (DNase I) enzyme. It is produced in genetically modified Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using recombinant DNA technology. The 260-amino acid sequence of dornase alfa is identical to the endogenous human enzyme. Dornase alfa cleaves extracellular DNA to 5Â´-phosphodinucleotide and 5Â´-phosphooligonucleotide end products without affecting intracellular DNA. In individuals with cystic fibrosis, extracellular DNA, which is an extremely viscous anion, is released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate during inflammatory responses to infections. Enzymatic breakdown of this extracellular DNA appears to reduce sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity.</span>

It binds to thrombin and prevents thrombus or clot formation. It is a highly potent, selective, and essentially irreversible inhibitor of thrombin and clot-bond thrombin. Lepirudin requires no cofactor for its anticoagulant action. Lepirudin is a recombinant form of hirudin, an endogenous anticoagulant found in medicinal leeches.</span>

EGFr is over-expressed in many colorectal cancers. Cetuximab competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other ligands, such as transforming growth factorâ€“alpha. Binding of cetuximab to the EGFr blocks phosphorylation and activation of receptor-associated kinases, resulting in inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, decreased matrix metalloproteinase secretion and reduced vascular endothelial growth factor production.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 3 Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease characterized by the retention of viscous purulent secretions in the airways. These thick secretions contribute both to reduced pulmonary function and to frequent pulmonary infection. Purulent pulmonary secretions of individuals with cystic fibrosis contain very high concentrations of extracellular DNA released by degenerating leukocytes that accumulate in response to these infections. Dornase alfa hydrolyzes the DNA in sputum of CF patients and reduces sputum viscosity and viscoelasticity. The enzyme does not appear to affect sputum in the absence of an inflammatory response to infection, nor does it affect the sputum of healthy individuals.</span>

The human IL-2 receptor exists in three forms, low (CD25), intermediate (CD122/CD132) and high (CD25/CD122/CD132) affinity. Malignant cells expressing one or more of the subunits of the IL-2 receptor are found in certain leukemias and lymphomas including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Ontak interacts with the high affinity IL-2 receptor on the cell surface and inhibits cellular protein synthesis, resulting in cell death within hours.</span>

Such processes or molecules affected include the level of adhesion molecules expressed, as well as serum levels of cytokines and matrix metalloproteinase-3, also known as stromelysin. In animal models, etanarcept has been demonstrated to affect inflammation, such as in murine collagen-induced arthritis.</span>

The action of bivalirudin is reversible because thrombin will slowly cleave the thrombin-bivalirudin bond which recovers the active site of thrombin.</span>

EGFr is over-expressed in many colorectal cancers. Cetuximab competitively inhibits the binding of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and TGF alpha, thereby reducing their effects on cell growth and metastatic spread.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 3                                         Dornase alfa is a biosynthetic form of human DNase I. The enzyme is involved in endonucleolytic cleavage of extracellular DNA to 5Â´-phosphodinucleotide and 5Â´-phosphooligonucleotide end products. It has no effect on intracellular DNA. Optimal activity is dependent on the presence of divalent cations such as calcium and magnesium. Extracellular DNA is a viscous anionic polymer and its breakdown appears to improve the viscosity and viscoelasticity of purulent sputum of individuals with CF, thus reducing airflow obstruction. Dornase alfa does not seem to have any effect on non-purulent sputum.</span>

The IL-2 receptor (Tac) subunit is expressed on activated but not resting lymphocytes. The diphtheria toxin associated with Ontak then selectively kills the IL-2 bearing cells.</span>
<span class="co">#&gt; 5 There are two distinct receptors for TNF (TNFRs), a 55 kilodalton protein (p55) and a 75 kilodalton protein (p75). The biological activity of TNF is dependent upon binding to either cell surface receptor (p75 or p55). Etanercept is a dimeric soluble form of the p75 TNF receptor that can bind to two TNF molecules, thereby effectively removing them from circulation.\r\n\r\nTNF is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in normal inflammatory and immune responses. Increased levels of TNF are found in tissues and fluids of those with rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and plaque psoriasis.</span>

Thrombin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release.</span>

<span class="co">#&gt; 2 Pulmonary Toxicity\r\n\r\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) was reported in 3 of 633 (&lt;0.5%) patients with advanced colorectal cancer receiving cetuximab. Interstitial pneumonitis with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema resulting in death was reported in one case. Two patients had pre-existing fibrotic lung disease and experienced an acute exacerbation of their disease while receiving cetuximab in combination with irinotecan. In the clinical investigational program, an additional case of interstitial pneumonitis was reported in a patient with head and neck cancer treated with cetuximab and cisplatin. The onset of symptoms occurred between the fourth and eleventh doses of treatment in all reported cases.</span>

Reported adverse effects include chest pain (pleuritic/non-cardiac), fever, dyspepsia, voice alteration (hoarseness), pharyngitis, dyspnea, laryngitis, rhinitis, decreased lung function, rash, urticaria, and conjunctivitis. There is no evidence of carcinogenic or mutagenic properties. The safety of dornase alfa has not been studied in pregnant women, nursing women and children under the age of 5 years old.</span>

<p>Each data frame is named based on its position in DrugBankâ€™s data hierarchy. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>Drugs</code>: is the master data frame at the root of the hierarchy that contains the list of all drugs in DrugBank.</li>
<li>
<code>Enzymes_Drug</code>: is the data frame containing the <em>enzymes</em> info pertaining to the drugs in the <code>Drugs</code> data frame. In other words,</li>
<li>
<code>Enzymes:</code> is a child of <code>Drug</code> in the hierarchy (i.e.Â Drug â€“&gt; Enzymes).</li>
<li>
<code>Enzymes_Pathway_Drug</code>: is the data frame containing the <em>enzymes</em> info pertaining to the <em>pathways</em> that the drugs in <code>Drugs</code> are involved in (i.e.Â Drug â€“&gt; Pathways â€“&gt; Enzymes).</li>
